After learning from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate  - I completed the data cleaning task for the uploded Excel file. 
you can view the spreadsheet files, before and after cleaning. <br><br>
Technologies used:<br>
1.elect and eliminate rows containing blank cells by using filters.
2.convert the data from the current long format (more rows than columns) to the wide format (more columns than rows). This action is called transposing.
